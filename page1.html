      <h1>ANIME SHOWS</h1>
      <p>

        Anime sometimes called Japanimation, is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan.
        The term anime is derived from the English word animation, and in Japan is used to refer to all forms of
        animated media.
        Outside Japan, the term refers specifically to animation from Japan or to a Japanese-disseminated animation
        style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.

        <h2>Dragon Ball Z</h2>
        <p>Dragon Ball Z is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation.
          It was broadcast in at least 81 countries worldwide.
          It is part of the Dragon Ball media franchise.
          Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of Goku, who, along with his companions,
          defend the Earth against villains ranging from aliens (Frieza), androids (Cell)
          and magical creatures (Majin Buu). While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from childhood
          to early adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels
          the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of his rival Vegeta.
