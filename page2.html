                <p>
                    Anime which was made in Japan, is hand-drawn and computer animation.

                <h2>Why is Anime so popular?</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main reasons why anime has stood the test of time and grown in popularity
                    across the world is due to its unique ability to grow with its viewers.

                </p>

                <p>The famous anime expert, Takamasa Sakurai, claims that the genre has been widely accepted due
                    to its unconventional nature, “Japanese anime broke the convention that anime is something that kids
                    watch”.
                    Overseas fans of anime claim that they enjoy the intensity of the storylines with the endings being
                    difficult
                    to predict as anime is often targeted at adult audiences.</p>

                <h2>What is the major differences of Japanese animation and American animation?</h2>
                <p>
                    First, art style. Japanese animation has a distinct art style, and uses sophisticated camera
                    movement and effects, for example. And of course anime is made to look visually stunning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, story content and style. Japanese animation is generally more philosophical and
                    character-oriented. Even in humorous Japanese animation films, the character's struggles and lessons
                    learned often form the core of the story. Also, characters in Japanese animation are generally more
                    realistic, more interesting, and more three dimensional.
